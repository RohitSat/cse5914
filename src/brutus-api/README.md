# brutus-api

TODO.

Make sure to include a credential file named auth.json in the src/brutus-api directory
This file should include your username and password for the natural language processor service and should be formatted like 'auth_sample.json' that is in the src/brutus_api directory.

Do not commit this file since it holds your credentials -- it is included in the .gitignore.
